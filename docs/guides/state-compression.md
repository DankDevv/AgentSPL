# State Compression Guide

## Overview

AgentSPL uses Solana's state compression to reduce storage costs and improve transaction efficiency.

## Implementation

```typescript
interface CompressionConfig {
  maxDepth: number;      // Maximum depth of the merkle tree
  maxBufferSize: number; // Maximum size of the change log buffer
  proofConfig: {         // Configuration for proof verification
    strategy: 'concurrent' | 'sequential'
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Storage Costs**: Up to 98% reduction in storage costs
2. **Higher Throughput**: Process more transactions per second
3. **Lower Gas Fees**: Reduced transaction size means lower fees
