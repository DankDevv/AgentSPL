# Core Concepts

## Solana Program Library (SPL) Tokens

SPL tokens are Solana's standard for fungible and non-fungible tokens, similar to ERC-20 on Ethereum. AgentSPL implements this standard with additional features:

- Full SPL token compliance
- State compression optimization
- Advanced token management
- Metadata support

## State Compression

AgentSPL utilizes Solana's state compression to:

- Reduce storage costs
- Improve transaction efficiency
- Enable scalable token operations

### How State Compression Works

1. **Merkle Trees**: Uses concurrent merkle trees for efficient data storage
2. **Change Logs**: Maintains compressed change logs
3. **Proof Verification**: Implements efficient proof verification

## Token Architecture

### Components

1. **Token Program**
   - Token creation and management
   - Transfer operations
   - Account management

2. **State Management**
   - Compressed state handling
   - Merkle tree operations
   - Proof generation and verification

3. **Extensions**
   - Metadata program integration
   - Custom token features
   - Advanced operations

## Implementation Details

```rust
pub struct CompressedToken {
    pub mint: Pubkey,
    pub authority: Pubkey,
    pub supply: u64,
    pub decimals: u8,
    pub compression_config: CompressionConfig,
}
```

## Security Considerations

- Authority validation
- Supply management
- State compression integrity
- Transaction safety
